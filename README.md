# MemeClassifier
MemeClassifier identifies if a image is meme or not using Deep Learning(Convolution Neural Network).
Its my first deep learning project ever. This is an experimental project to get me started with Deep Learning.
This may not be the best solution (because that wasnt my aim) but it is clean and easily readable/interpretable implementation with each step clearly mentioned. 

NOTE: It doesn't classify different types of meme eg- evil kermit, grumpy cat etc.
