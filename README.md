# MemeClassifier
MemeClassifier identifies if a image is meme or not, using Deep Learning(Convolution Neural Network).It also uses tranfer learning (MobileNet_V2).</br>
Accuracy - ~94% . The dataset used was small (about 1700 images of each class for training); the accuracy can be increased further by increasing the size of dataset.</br>
Its my first deep learning project. This is an experimental project to get me started with Deep Learning.
This may not be the best solution (because that wasnt my aim) but it is clean and easily readable/interpretable implementation with each step clearly mentioned.

NOTE: It doesn't classify different types of meme eg- evil kermit, grumpy cat etc.
