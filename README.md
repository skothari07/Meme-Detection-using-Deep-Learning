# Meme Detection using Deep Learning
* This project is implemented using Tensorflow and Keras.
* It is a Binary Classifier that identifies if an image is meme or not (using Convolution Neural Network).
* Uses tranfer learning (MobileNet_V2).
* Accuracy - ~93% .The dataset used was small (about 1600 images of each class for training); the accuracy can be increased further by increasing the size of dataset.</br>
* Its my first deep learning project. This is an experimental project to get me started with Deep Learning.
* This may not be the best solution (because that wasn't the aim) but it is clean and easily readable/interpretable implementation with each step clearly mentioned.

NOTE: It doesn't classify different types of meme eg- evil kermit, grumpy cat etc.
